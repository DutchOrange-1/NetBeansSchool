# NetBeansSchool

This is made for my files ONLY. You can use these files for learning BUT DONT copy and past this code. MAKE IT YOURSELF. 
These will be the basic projects, The folder names will be changed to so it wont be "PLug and play", preferably for the simpler ones
just copy via the .java file and nothing else. The class / Project WILL NOT be conected correctly to your NetBeans IDE. 

Code can be found in: (This is just an example) 
NetBeansSchool / FirstProject / src/firstproject / firstproject.java

This is made by Brandon de Greef in Gr10 Crawford Ruimsig as an eaiser way to move code and share it.
